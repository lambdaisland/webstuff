Mechanisms

- Source code sweep to find use tokens
- View macro that scans for tokens
- Use :class to include tokens
- Use :style to include tokens
- Compile inline tokens to `my_ns_line_123` class name
- Use inline tokens directly in compiled CSS
- Convert tokens to inline `:style` attributes

Principles
- Avoid doing Girouette compilation in the frontend, prefer compiling in the back
- Keep girouette and garden out of the frontend build

Backend
- static
-> should be a class included in CSS
-> scan source?
-> collapse classes?
- dynamic/on-the-fly
Frontend
- static
- dynamic/on-the-fly
